# Language-Detection-Neural-Network-Spring-
ðŸŽ“ 4th year Artificial Intelligence project. Using the Encog library, it uses vector hashing in conjunction with K-Fold Cross Validation to train a neural network using the WiLI Language Dataset. This neural network can then be used to predict the language of an input.
